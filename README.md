Food wastage is a growing problem in the world.Making food requires a huge amount of resources starting from water,soil,fertilizers,etc for the plant, to fuel for transportation of the crop,to lpg gas required to cook the food.Wasting it would mean the wastage of all these resources too.The unequal distribution of food leads to the people with filled bellies getting more food and the hungry getting even hungrier.This leads to the increase in world hunger too.Enormous amount of food wastage occurs especially in parties,restaurants,etc.The excess food always ends up in the dustbin or with people who aren't in dire need of it(for convenience sake it is given to people closest to the source).Our app focuses on solving this crisis, by reducing world hunger, improving the general health of people who need food and inturn improving the sustainability of our planet by not letting the resources used to make the excess food go in waste.
